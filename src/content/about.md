# About Me

Hi, I'm Mathieu, a Software Engineer. I'm the CTO of [Kakarot](https://kakarot.org/), a company that works on developing efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs systems for client-side proving.

I've also been working on a few side projects over the years, including writing a book about the [Cairo Programming Language](https://book.cairo-lang.org);
an AI conversational agent for the [Starknet Ecosystem](https://agent.starknet.io), or an [API for Cairo Code generation](https://www.cairo-coder.com/) that can be plugged to any agentic tool using MCP.

I have a Master's degree in Engineering from [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/), and a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Universit√§t Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/).
